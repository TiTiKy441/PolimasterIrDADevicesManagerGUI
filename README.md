# PolimasterIrDADevicesManagerGUI
Utility for managing polimaster's irda devices with a windows GUI.

This software is based on the reverse engineering of the polimaster's IrDA communications protocol.

# Manual
This software was mainly made for testing out different devices and their IrDA protocols. That's why there are so much test windows like Command mapper, IrDA communications window and an EEPROM manager window. It may not be the most pleasant program to use for an ordinary user, but, for devices like PM1401GN, this program works significantly better than the PM PRD app. It's more pleasant to use and also has bigger functionality, including changing the device's calibration value as well as changing the device's overload threshold and viewing the battery status.
